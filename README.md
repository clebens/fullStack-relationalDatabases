# Tournament Results Project
## created by Colin Lebens <br>(for Udacity Relational Databases course)

**Notes on Execution:**

- The tournament.sql file should be executed within postgres (psql) when the 'tournament' database is currently loaded to delete conflicting table schemas and add the appropraite table schemas and views.

- API for communicating with the database is contained in the tournament.py file.

- Supplied unit tests are provided in tournament\_test.py
